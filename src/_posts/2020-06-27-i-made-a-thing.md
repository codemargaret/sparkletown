The thing is fuchsia. It could also have been `default` (teal), `rust`, or `fineart`(black). 

I followed the Bridgetown [installation docs](https://www.bridgetownrb.com/docs/installation) and [quick instructions](https://www.bridgetownrb.com/docs/) to create a basic Hello Bridgetown site. After that, adding the [Bulmatown](https://github.com/whitefusionhq/bulmatown) theme was easy, and quickly made it look polished enough to actually go on the real Internet.
